# Session 1 - Introduction

Based on the transcript, here's an introduction lecture for this NLP for Social Science course:

Welcome to our course on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Social Science. This course aims to bridge the gap between NLP techniques and social science research methodologies, providing you with the tools to leverage text data in your studies.

Key points we'll cover include:

1. The basics of NLP and its applications in social science research
2. The NLP pipeline: from raw text to meaningful insights
3. Common NLP tasks like classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling
4. How to use modern NLP tools and models, including large language models like GPT
5. Practical applications of NLP in social science contexts

It's important to understand that NLP has evolved significantly in recent years. While traditionally, researchers had to build models from scratch, we now have access to powerful pre-trained models that can be adapted for specific tasks. This has made NLP more accessible, but it also means we need to think critically about how to best utilize these tools in our research.

Throughout this course, we'll discuss both the opportunities and challenges of using NLP in social science. We'll explore how to frame research questions that can be answered with NLP techniques, how to prepare and preprocess text data, and how to interpret and validate results.

Remember, the goal isn't just to use NLP because it's trendy, but to leverage it as a tool to gain new insights and answer important questions in your field. We'll emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying principles of NLP, even as we use advanced tools that abstract away much of the complexity.

As we progress, I encourage you to think about how you might apply these techniques to your own research interests. Don't hesitate to ask questions and engage in discussions â€“ that's how we'll all learn and grow throughout this course.

Let's embark on this journey to explore the exciting intersection of NLP and social science!
