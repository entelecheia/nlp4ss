# 2.3 Topic Modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

1. Introduction to Topic Modeling

   - Definition and purpose of topic modeling
   - Applications in social science research
   - Overview of different topic modeling approaches

2. Fundamentals of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

   - Conceptual overview of LDA
   - Key assumptions and intuitions behind the model
   - Probabilistic generative process in LDA

3. Mathematical Foundation of LDA

   - Dirichlet distribution
   - Multinomial distribution
   - Plate notation for LDA

4. LDA Algorithm

   - Generative process
   - Inference problem
   - Parameter estimation techniques (e.g., variational inference, Gibbs sampling)

5. Preparing Data for LDA

   - Preprocessing steps specific to topic modeling
   - Creating document-term matrix
   - Considerations for vocabulary size and document length

6. Implementing LDA

   - Tools and libraries for LDA (e.g., gensim, scikit-learn)
   - Step-by-step implementation in Python
   - Handling parameters (number of topics, alpha, beta)

7. Interpreting LDA Results

   - Understanding topic-word distributions
   - Analyzing document-topic distributions
   - Visualizing topic models (e.g., pyLDAvis)

8. Evaluating Topic Models

   - Perplexity and coherence scores
   - Human evaluation of topic quality
   - Stability and reproducibility of topics

9. Advanced Topic Modeling Techniques

   - Dynamic Topic Models
   - Hierarchical LDA
   - Correlated Topic Models

10. Applications in Social Science Research

    - Content analysis of large text corpora
    - Trend analysis in social media data
    - Policy document analysis
    - Literary analysis and digital humanities applications

11. Challenges and Limitations of LDA

    - Determining the optimal number of topics
    - Handling short texts and social media data
    - Dealing with multi-lingual corpora

12. Combining Topic Modeling with Other NLP Techniques

    - Integration with sentiment analysis
    - Using topic models for document classification
    - Enhancing information retrieval with topic models

13. Future Directions in Topic Modeling
    - Neural topic models
    - Incorporating word embeddings into topic models
    - Cross-lingual topic modeling
