# 2.2 Basic NLP Tasks

## 1. Introduction to Fundamental NLP Tasks

Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses a wide range of tasks that are crucial for analyzing and understanding human language. In social science research, these tasks can provide valuable insights into textual data, such as social media posts, survey responses, or historical documents.

Some common applications of NLP in social science research include:

- Analyzing public opinion on social issues
- Studying communication patterns in online communities
- Extracting themes from open-ended survey responses
- Tracking changes in language use over time

The importance of these tasks lies in their ability to process and analyze large volumes of text data efficiently, revealing patterns and insights that might be difficult or time-consuming to identify manually.

## 2. Text Classification

Text classification is the task of assigning predefined categories to text documents. It's widely used in social science research for various purposes, such as categorizing survey responses or identifying topics in social media posts.

### Types of classification:

- Binary classification: Two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam)
- Multi-class classification: More than two mutually exclusive classes
- Multi-label classification: Multiple non-exclusive labels per document

### Example: Multi-class Classification

Let's implement a simple text classifier using scikit-learn to categorize news articles into different topics.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Sample data
texts = [
    "The stock market saw significant gains today",
    "A new study shows the impact of climate change on biodiversity",
    "The local sports team won their championship game",
    "Scientists discover a new planet in a distant solar system",
    "Political tensions rise as new policies are announced"
]
labels = ['finance', 'science', 'sports', 'science', 'politics']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature extraction
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train the classifier
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_vectorized)

# Evaluate the model
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This example demonstrates a basic workflow for text classification, including feature extraction using TF-IDF, training a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluating its performance.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. It's particularly useful for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, or social media sentiment.

### Example: Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis

We'll use the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer, which is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    if sentiment['compound'] >= 0.05:
        return 'Positive'
    elif sentiment['compound'] <= -0.05:
        return 'Negative'
    else:
        return 'Neutral'

# Example usage
texts = [
    "I love this new policy! It's going to help so many people.",
    "This decision is terrible and will have negative consequences.",
    "The weather is cloudy today."
]

for text in texts:
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {analyze_sentiment(text)}\n")
```

This example demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis using a lexicon-based approach. For more complex scenarios or domain-specific applications, machine learning-based approaches might be more suitable.

## 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in text. It's crucial for extracting structured information from unstructured text data.

### Example: NER using spaCy

```python
import spacy

def perform_ner(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
    return entities

# Example usage
text = "Apple Inc. is planning to open a new store in New York City next month, according to CEO Tim Cook."
entities = perform_ner(text)

print("Named Entities:")
for entity, label in entities:
    print(f"{entity} - {label}")
```

This example uses spaCy, a popular NLP library, to perform named entity recognition. It identifies entities like organizations, locations, and person names in the given text.

## 5. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

POS tagging is the process of marking up words in a text with their corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). It's fundamental for understanding the grammatical structure of text.

### Example: POS Tagging with NLTK

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

def pos_tag_text(text):
    words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)
    return pos_tags

# Example usage
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tagged_text = pos_tag_text(text)

print("POS Tags:")
for word, tag in tagged_text:
    print(f"{word} - {tag}")
```

This example uses NLTK to perform part-of-speech tagging on a given text. Understanding the grammatical structure can be useful for various NLP tasks and linguistic analysis.

## 6. Text Summarization

Text summarization involves creating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text while preserving its key information. It's particularly useful for processing large volumes of text data in social science research.

### Example: Extractive Summarization

Here's a simple example of extractive summarization using sentence scoring:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def summarize_text(text, num_sentences=3):
    # Tokenize the text into sentences
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)

    # Calculate word frequencies
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    word_freq = {}
    for word in words:
        if word not in stop_words:
            if word not in word_freq:
                word_freq[word] = 1
            else:
                word_freq[word] += 1

    # Calculate sentence scores
    sentence_scores = {}
    for sentence in sentences:
        for word in word_tokenize(sentence.lower()):
            if word in word_freq:
                if sentence not in sentence_scores:
                    sentence_scores[sentence] = word_freq[word]
                else:
                    sentence_scores[sentence] += word_freq[word]

    # Get top sentences
    import heapq
    summary_sentences = heapq.nlargest(num_sentences, sentence_scores, key=sentence_scores.get)

    return ' '.join(summary_sentences)

# Example usage
text = """Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves."""

summary = summarize_text(text)
print("Summary:")
print(summary)
```

This example demonstrates a basic extractive summarization technique. It scores sentences based on the frequency of non-stop words and selects the top-scoring sentences as the summary.

## 7. Text Similarity and Clustering

Text similarity measures how alike two pieces of text are, while clustering groups similar texts together. These techniques are useful for organizing and analyzing large text datasets.

### Example: Document Similarity and Clustering

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def cluster_documents(documents, num_clusters=2):
    # Create TF-IDF vectors
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

    # Perform clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters)
    kmeans.fit(tfidf_matrix)

    # Calculate document similarity
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)

    return kmeans.labels_, similarity_matrix

# Example usage
documents = [
    "The cat sat on the mat",
    "The dog played in the yard",
    "The mat was on the floor",
    "The yard was full of flowers"
]

clusters, similarity = cluster_documents(documents)

print("Clusters:")
for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
    print(f"Document {i}: Cluster {clusters[i]}")

print("\nSimilarity Matrix:")
print(similarity)
```

This example demonstrates document clustering using K-means and calculates document similarity using cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors.

## 8. Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a statistical method for discovering abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. It's particularly useful for analyzing large corpora of text in social science research.

### Example: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Gensim

```python
from gensim import corpora
from gensim.models.ldamodel import LdaModel
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def preprocess(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    return [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha() and token not in stop_words]

documents = [
    "The cat and the dog",
    "The dog chased the cat",
    "The cat climbed a tree",
    "Dogs are loyal pets",
    "Cats are independent animals"
]

# Preprocess the documents
processed_docs = [preprocess(doc) for doc in documents]

# Create a dictionary representation of the documents
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(processed_docs)

# Create a corpus
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in processed_docs]

# Train the LDA model
lda_model = LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=2, random_state=42)

# Print the topics
print("Topics:")
for idx, topic in lda_model.print_topics(-1):
    print(f"Topic: {idx}")
    print(topic)
    print()
```

This example demonstrates how to perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with the Gensim library. It processes a small set of documents, creates a bag-of-words representation, and then trains an LDA model to discover latent topics in the text.

## 9. Challenges and Limitations

While these basic NLP tasks are powerful, they come with challenges:

1. Domain-specific language: Models trained on general text may perform poorly on specialized domains (e.g., medical or legal texts).
2. Informal text: Social media data often contains slang, abbreviations, and nonstandard language use, which can be challenging for NLP models.
3. Low-resource languages: Many NLP tools and models perform best for English and other widely-spoken languages, with less support for low-resource languages.
4. Context and nuance: Understanding sarcasm, irony, or cultural references remains challenging for many NLP systems.

## 10. Evaluation and Interpretation

When applying these NLP tasks in social science research, it's crucial to:

1. Choose appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, inter-annotator agreement)
2. Interpret results in the context of your research questions
3. Be aware of potential biases in your data and models
4. Combine computational methods with qualitative analysis for a more comprehensive understanding

Remember that while these NLP tasks can process large amounts of text data quickly, they should be seen as tools to augment, not replace, careful human analysis in social science research.

## Conclusion

These basic NLP tasks form the foundation for more complex analyses in social science research. By mastering these techniques, researchers can:

1. Automatically categorize large volumes of text data
2. Gauge public sentiment on various issues
3. Extract structured information from unstructured text
4. Understand the linguistic structure of text data
5. Summarize long documents efficiently
6. Discover latent themes in large text corpora
