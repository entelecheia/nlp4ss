project_description: NLP for Social Science (nlp4ss) is a comprehensive, multilingual
    course and toolkit designed to bridge the gap between natural language processing
    (NLP) and social science research. This project provides researchers, students,
    and practitioners with the knowledge and tools to apply cutting-edge NLP techniques
    to social science questions. It covers a wide range of topics, including text
    preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and machine learning applications
    in social contexts. With interactive Jupyter notebooks, hands-on examples, and
    real-world case studies, nlp4ss offers a practical approach to integrating computational
    methods into social science research.
