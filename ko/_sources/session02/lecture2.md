# 2.2 Basic NLP Tasks

1. Introduction to Fundamental NLP Tasks

   - Overview of common applications in social science research
   - Importance of these tasks in text analysis

2. Text Classification

   - Definition and use cases
   - Binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification
   - Feature extraction for classification
   - Common algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)
   - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

3. Sentiment Analysis

   - Understanding sentiment polarity
   - Lexicon-based approaches
   - Machine learning approaches
   - Challenges in sentiment analysis (e.g., sarcasm, context)
   - Applications in social media analysis and opinion mining

4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

   - Definition and importance in social science
   - Types of named entities (e.g., person, organization, location)
   - Rule-based NER systems
   - Statistical and machine learning approaches to NER
   - Evaluation of NER systems

5. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

   - Understanding grammatical structure
   - Common POS tag sets
   - Rule-based and statistical POS tagging approaches
   - Applications in text analysis and information extraction

6. Text Summarization

   - Extractive vs. abstractive summarization
   - Basic techniques for extractive summarization
   - Evaluation of summarization quality

7. Information Extraction

   - Relation extraction
   - Event extraction
   - Applications in social science research

8. Text Similarity and Clustering

   - Measuring document similarity
   - Text clustering techniques
   - Applications in content analysis and topic identification

9. Language Detection

   - Importance in multilingual datasets
   - Approaches to language identification

10. Practical Implementation

    - Tools and libraries for basic NLP tasks (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
    - Hands-on examples using Python

11. Challenges and Limitations

    - Dealing with domain-specific language
    - Handling informal text (e.g., social media data)
    - Considerations for low-resource languages

12. Evaluation and Interpretation
    - Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics
    - Interpreting results in the context of social science research
