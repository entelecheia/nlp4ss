# Course Syllabus

## Course Description

This course introduces social science researchers to Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a specific focus on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social science applications. Students will learn how to apply cutting-edge NLP methods to analyze textual data, extract insights, and address complex social science research questions.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand fundamental NLP concepts and their relevance to social science research
2. Apply traditional NLP techniques and modern LLM-based approaches to social science data
3. Design and implement NLP-driven research projects in social science contexts
4. Critically evaluate the potential and limitations of NLP methods in social science research
5. Address ethical considerations in the use of AI and NLP in social science studies

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills in Python
- Familiarity with basic statistical concepts
- Understanding of fundamental social science research methods

## Course Structure

The course consists of five sessions, each covering key aspects of NLP for social science:

### Session 1: Introduction to NLP and Its Applications in Social Science

3. Ethical Considerations and Challenges in Using LLMs for Research

### Session 2: Traditional NLP Techniques and Text Preprocessing

1. Text Cleaning, Normalization, and Representation
2. Basic NLP Tasks
3. Topic Modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

### Session 3: LLMs for Data Annotation and Classification

1. Zero-shot Learning with LLMs
2. Few-shot Learning and Prompt Engineering
3. Comparing LLM Performance with Traditional Supervised Learning

### Session 4: Generative Explanations and Summaries in Social Science

1. Using LLMs for High-Quality Text Generation
2. Social Bias Inference and Analysis
3. Figurative Language Explanation and Cultural Context

### Session 5: Advanced Applications of LLMs in Social Science Research

1. Analyzing Large-Scale Textual Data
2. Misinformation and Fake News Detection
3. Future Directions and Emerging Trends
